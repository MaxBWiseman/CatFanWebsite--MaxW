#Cat Fan Website by Max Wiseman#

I intend this website to be functional for a group of individuals that enjoy the company of cats just as much as humans and want to talk and share there storys whilst providing advice to people with similar intrests. My website acts as a hub to show the world:

1. A page that shows clearly when and wear meetups take place, and what time

2. Competitions that are currentley on offer with prizes displayed

3. A fun collection of cat pictures with funny captions next to them in various scenarios

4. A small hub for cat related news articles

5. A place to gather email addresses and other data required to promote such a group

6. Provide quick facts and advice through interactive clickable icons

7. A fun brief weekly cat related quiz to test your knowledge on

8. A page to fill in our compeition application

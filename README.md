![alt text](assets/images/knownbug.png)

### 2. Update on responsive design bug, removed map for tablet view and hid mobile only footer, centering still needed.
![alt text](assets/images/knownbug2.png)

### 3. Temporary fix with centering with 'margin-left:75px;'

### 4. Githubs version of markdown does not support the <u></u> tags, changed to '**' asterisk bold in my readme file.

### 5. There is a strange bug with responsive design were sometimes using developer tools on my website to check responsivness, it doesnt work and requires to select a phone screen (e.g Samsung Galaxy S8+) and then responsiveness kicks in again. Not sure what causes this hiccup. Here is a video posted to youtube as the file size was too big for github, to explain the strange issue -
